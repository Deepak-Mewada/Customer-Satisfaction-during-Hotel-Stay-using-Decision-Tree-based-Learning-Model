Customer Satisfaction during Hotel-Stay using Decision Tree based Learning Model

Group Project | Mini Project | Machine Leanring Course | Semester2

###Objective:
 In a five star hotel, the hotel inspection authority is conducting a survey based on automated
learning methods. They want to keep track whether a customer feels satisfied based on several hotel attributes
as well as the amenity being provided to him/her. However, when they look at the customer attributes and their
satisfaction profile, they are puzzled to find out any deterministic rule to characterize these features. So, they
are looking for machine learning experts to help them in this work. In particular, looking at their need to explain
the customer satisfaction requirements, they need you to frame a decision tree based model for them aiding
this task fulfilment.
